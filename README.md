# simple-calculator
A Java project for a simple calculator with GUI implemented through the use of the Swing framework. 

Supported operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, square root, absolute value and negation. 

Note that operations may be performed on up to only two numbers at a time. Moreover, the calculator does not support negative number parsing, although the first operand may be made negative through the use of the neg(x) (that is, -x) operator. 

Floating point operations are also supported (with double precision). In addition, two different themes can be picked for the calculator's GUI: dark (on by default) and light.
